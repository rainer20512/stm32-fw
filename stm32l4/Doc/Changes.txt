Changes in STM32L4 source tree                             Created 14.11.20 RHB
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These changes are marked with /**** <nnn> ****/ in sourcecode, 
where <nnn> is the threeed igit number from below

001 Extended THP_Sensor class to support CO2 and TVOC sensors

002 Extended lcd_status.h / lcd_status.c to display CCS811 sensor values 
    In order to do that, the number of display schemes was increased by 1 ( now  0..4 )

*** 23.08.21 replaced "debuglevel" by  "console_debuglevel" to gain identicalness to the STM32H7-FW code

*** 23.08.21 Changed CubeFW Version from V1.14 to 1.17

*** 23.08.21 Version V1.04

003 Adaptions for STM32L4+ series

004 Unify the handling of assigning DMA channels/requests: in case of no DMA Multiplexer is implemented, the
    assignment is fixed, in case of DMA MUX present, a handcrafted DMA Manager will assign Channels one by one
    When no DMA Multiplexer is present, the preprocesser symbol HAS_NO_DMAMUX is set to 1.

005 Unify the PLL programming / handling for all three PLLs in ppl.c, pll.h and pll_config.h
    ToDo: Restart PLLs after STOP when SYSCLK source is not a PLL

006 THPSENSOR_GetP() will always return the local pressure. To get the pressure at MSL, this value has to be
    compensated, ie add the pressure difference between local elevation and MSL, which is 1hPa per 30 ft
    To keep it easy, THPSENSOR provides two functions to read the pressure:
       int32_t              THPSENSOR_GetLocalP    (void);   /* local pressure */
       int32_t              THPSENSOR_GetP_MSL     (void);   /* local pressure at MSL */
    the function THPSENSOR_GetP is no longer available
    the global variable bmp_pressure is no longe available, so it is no longer supplied by "watch.c"

007 Display relative humidity in display scheme 0 

008 Uart_Dev: Check, whether CircBuff or LinBuf is used oer whether simple array is assigned as transfer buffer

009 New Device type EXT_TYPE_MULTITEMP for multiple DS18X20 temperature sensor tied to one device

010 Removed all PWM specific items from timer-dev. New device PWM Timer in pwm_timer.c: PWM Timer and Channel
    settings have to be defined in Macros HW_PWM_CHANNELS and USER_PWM_CHANNLS
    Made all Projects (STM32L476, STM32H742, STM32H7 dual ) compileable after changes 
    Removed Autostart-Item from PWM channels: PWM Outputs will have to be started manually in any case
    Added field "bUserByt" ins PWM channel struct to do whatever user wants
