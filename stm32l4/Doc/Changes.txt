Changes in STM32L4 source tree                             Created 14.11.20 RHB
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These changes are marked with /**** <nnn> ****/ in sourcecode, 
where <nnn> is the threeed igit number from below

001 Extended THP_Sensor class to support CO2 and TVOC sensors

002 Extended lcd_status.h / lcd_status.c to display CCS811 sensor values 
    In order to do that, the number of display schemes was increased by 1 ( now  0..4 )

*** 23.08.21 replaced "debuglevel" by  "console_debuglevel" to gain identicalness to the STM32H7-FW code

*** 23.08.21 Changed CubeFW Version from V1.14 to 1.17

*** 23.08.21 Version V1.04

003 Adaptions for STM32L4+ series

004 Unify the handling of assigning DMA channels/requests: in case of no DMA Multiplexer is implemented, the
    assignment is fixed, in case of DMA MUX present, a handcrafted DMA Manager will assign Channels one by one
    When no DMA Multiplexer is present, the preprocesser symbol HAS_NO_DMAMUX is set to 1.
