HowTo repair a bricked Portenta H7 board                           RHB 26.07.23
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portenta H7 board contains a programmable Power Controller ( NXP PM1550 )
which controls nearly all Voltages on board. This controller has to be 
programmed properly to get everything powered, including the STM32H747XI

Normally, this is done by the Portenta bootloader, which resides 
from 0x08000000-0x083ffffff.

If your own code overwrites this, then your own code MUST contain the proper
PMIC initialization code. If not, the portenta H7 board is bricked, which is 
indicated by the orange "led" of death. 

The only way to reaspire the board is to externally program the PMIC via I2C1.
The required pins are accessible via the portenta breakout board, e.g.

This folder contains a shell script for raspberry Pi which does the neccessary
setup of the PMIC.

After programming, press the blue "On" button on the breakout board and reprogram
the bootloader with a STLINK or JLINK compatible programmer.
