   1. When then STM Cube Directory is changed:
      THe easiest way is to open the project file as xml file, then search and replace the hard code STM Cube directory 

   2. DMA memory has to reside in an area that is not chaced by D-Cache. To create it, define an power-of-2 sized ram area in SRAM1-4 
      (not AXISRAM, this cannot be accessed by DMA1 and DMA2) and define it as not cacheable and not bufferable to MPU. All types of
      DMA memory then sould be allocated (statically or dynamically) only in this area. To ease that in hardware.h

           #define DMAMEM   __attribute((section(".dmamem")))  

      is defined. Also in the flash_placement.xml we added an section

           <ProgramSection alignment="4" load="No" name=".dmamem" />

      in the non cacheable RAM area.
